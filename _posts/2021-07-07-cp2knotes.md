This is my first time using `cp2k` and this notes is composed for future reference.

## basic knowledge

---

First, this is a cool CP2K ASCII art generated in the output file.

```shell
 **** **** ******  **
***** ** ***  *** ** 
**    ****   ******  
***** **    ** ** ** 
 **** **  *******  **
```

### Proper usage of `cp2k` on HPC

These are the basic command line options of cp2k, you basically load the module and write the following code in terminal:

```shell
# PC
cp2k.sopt -i input_file -o output_file &
# or HPC
mpirun -n 32 cp2k.popt input_file -o output_file &
# by defalut, if there is no output assinged, output goes to stdout.
```
However, this is not how we run jobs in HPC. We should use `lsf` script in 191 node.

```shell
# the *.lsf file
[rhbi@mgt02 00.calculate_energy_and_force]$ cat cp2k.lsf 
#!/bin/bash
#
#BSUB -q 52-medium					## lsf queue-name (small, medium, large)
#BSUB -W 12:00							## wall time, terminite this job after 12:00 hours
#BSUB -J rutile-e-f					## The job name
#BSUB -o cp2k.%J.stdout			## standard output file
#BSUB -e cp2k.%J.stderr			## standard error file
#BSUB -n 28									## use 28 cores (CPU)
#BSUB -R "span[ptile=28]"		## using 28 nodes per core

# add modulefiles
module load intel/17.5.239 mpi/intel/2017.5.239
module load gcc/5.5.0
module load cp2k/7.1

mpiexec.hydra cp2k.popt input.inp >& output_$LSB_JOBID

# actually submit using lsf system
busb < cp2k.lsf
```

In the `*.lsf` file, there are three parts. The first part starts with `#BSUB` determines the properties of a job (see the description in the above code block). The second part loads the required module used in this particular job. The final part is actually the true command to execute cp2k calculation.

> There are unkown terms, study on them
> - what is mpi? `mpiexec.hydra`?  `mpirun`
> - what is CPU **core**? what is **node**?

### Quick help

It's easy to check version or get help:
```shell
cp2k.popt -version
cp2k.popt -check input_file	# what does this do actually?
cp2k.popt -html-manual
cp2k.popt -help
```
> What does `cp2k.popt -check <input>.inp` do?

## Basic human-package interaction 
---

The directory of your job looks like:

```shell
[rhbi@mgt02 cp2k_tutorial]$ tree
.
├── 00.calculate_energy_and_force
│   ├── cp2k.178395.stderr
│   ├── cp2k.178395.stdout
│   ├── cp2k.lsf
│   ├── input.inp
│   ├── output_178395
│   ├── rutile.xyz
│   ├── Universality-RESTART.wfn
│   ├── Universality-RESTART.wfn.bak-1
│   ├── Universality-RESTART.wfn.bak-2
│   └── Universality-RESTART.wfn.bak-3
└── README.md

1 directory, 11 files
```

The basic human-package interaction with `cp2k` is:

1. feed `cp2k` the inputs
	- `input.inp`
	- `<structure>.xyz`
2. `lsf` script in HPC creates job, `cp2k` starts to work, generating files
3. `cp2k` spits out the following files
	- `*.restart` (input file to restart calculation)
	- `*.xyz` (trajectory for MD)
	- `*.ener` (MD energies, temperatures)
	- `*.cell` (cell parameters)
	- `*-RESTEART.wfn` (orbitals for restart)

## The structure of the input file
---

The information in the input file are preseted is different **sections**, which are marked in uppercase keywords like `GLOBAL`, `FORCE_EVAL`, ..., etc. The basic syntax of a `KEYWORD` section is 

```
&KEYWORD
	PROPERTY1 <PROPERTY1 value>
	PROPERTY2 <PROPERTY2 value>
	...
&END KEYWORD
```
The input file consists of many sections , and we tell what kind of calculation of we want to run by writting details in each section. The following code block contains the tutorial `cp2k` run of rutile energy-force calculatin.

```
# input.inp

&FORCE_EVAL
  METHOD QS
  &PRINT
    &FORCES ON
    &END FORCES

    &END KIND
  &END SUBSYS
&END FORCE_EVAL

&GLOBAL
  PROJECT Universality 
  RUN_TYPE ENERGY_FORCE
  PRINT_LEVEL MEDIUM
&END GLOBAL
```

The most important sections are`GLOBAL` and `FORCE_EVAL`, which contain the general options (job name, type of job) and all parameters associated with the evaluation of force respectively. We can see the above file contains only this two sections.

## The `GLOBAL` section
---

Let's start to look in to the structure of this file form the  `GLOBAL` section.

```
# The GLOBAL section

&GLOBAL
  PROJECT Universality	
  # dictate the name of  the .wfn file
  RUN_TYPE ENERGY_FORCE	
  # This is a energy-force calculation. Alternatively, this can also be GEO_OPT
  PRINT_LEVEL MEDIUM		
  # dictats the verbosity, ie how much information of output
&END GLOBAL
```

The global section contains the following info:

- name of the project
- how many is printed out
- what calculation job?

## The `FORCE_EVAL` section
---


More interestingly, the `FORCE_EVAL` part in more complex.

```
# The overall structure overview of FORCE_EVAL

&FORCE_EVAL
  METHOD QS
  &PRINT
	...
  &END PRINT
  &DFT
  ...
  &END DFT
  &SUBSYS
  ...
  &END SUBSYS
&END FORCE_EVAL
```
On the top of `FORCE_EVAL` part, the method of calculation is selected using KEYWORD `METHOD`, our system uses `QS`, which is the acronym of `Quickstep`. This will guarantee we are using **GPW method in Density Functional Theory** to calculate energy and force. Following are the subsections in `FORCE_EVAL`:

- `PRINT`: How much information you want to get
- `DFT`: Basis to use, the cutoff energy to select PW basis set, `EPS` tolerence, self consistance field setup, exchange-correlation (XC) setup,...,etc.
- `SUBSYS`: the cell parameters, atom coordinates (input via `*.xyz`), assign basis set and pseudopotential to each kind of atom, ..., etc.

### `PRINT` part in `FORCE_EVAL`section

```
# Print out the forces in the output file
&PRINT
	&FORCES ON
	&END FORCES
&END PRINT
```

The above section prints out the forces, like this

```
 ATOMIC FORCES in [a.u.]

 # Atom   Kind   Element          X              Y              Z

```

### The `DFT` subsection in section `FORCE_EVAL`

This section tailors the detail of DFT simulation, there's information about the following informations:

- `BASIS_SET_FILE_NAME` and `POTENTIAL_FILE_NAME`: literally is the basis and psuedopotential you are using. The admins have linked all the basis and potential files so we don't have to prepare them.
- `MGRID` subsection: Set a cutoff energy to determin how large the plane wave basis show be. (see [cp2k tutorial #1 **2019**](https://www.cp2k.org/events:2019_cp2k_workshop_ghent:index) for more details)
- `QS` subsection: In our example, contains only `EPS_DEFAULT`, which "Try setting all EPS_xxx to values leading to an energy correct up to `EPS_DEFAULT`"

> "parameters needed to set up the Quickstep framework"

- `XC` subsection: Literally exchange-correlation part. Remeber in KS-DFT formalism that the $E_{XC}[\rho]$ term is fitting by different functionals. This is exactly where we *assign* this functinal. In the tutorial example, PBE (Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof) functional is used.

- `SCF` subsection: This section tunes the self-consistent field method and details. 
	- `SCF_GUESS`: One can quickly setting up `RESTART` or `ATOMIC`. 

	> difference between `RESTART` and ``ATOMIC

	- `EPS_SCF` : "Target accuracy for the SCF convergence."
	- `MAX_SCF`: Literally the most # of iteration in SCF
	- `OUTER_SCF`: "The target gradient of the outer SCF variables. Notice that the EPS_SCF of the inner loop also determines the value that can be reached in the outer loop, typically EPS_SCF of the outer loop must be smaller than or equal to EPS_SCF of the inner loop.  "
	- `OT`: OT stands for the Orbital Transformation method, which is a method used in minimization. Faster but takes more step. (see [cp2k tutorial #1 **2019**](https://www.cp2k.org/events:2019_cp2k_workshop_ghent:index) for more details)
	
	> ? OT and Diag-DIIS, I thought they are different

The complete `FORCE_EVAL` in the example looks like

```
&SCF
   SCF_GUESS RESTART
   EPS_SCF 3.0E-7
   MAX_SCF 50
   &OUTER_SCF
     EPS_SCF 3.0E-7
     MAX_SCF 10
   &END OUTER_SCF
   &OT
     MINIMIZER DIIS
     PRECONDITIONER FULL_SINGLE_INVERSE
   &END OT
&END SCF
```

### The `SUBSYS` section

This section contains the geometry of our interested structure

> Section `SUBSYS`: a subsystem: coordinates, topology, molecules and cell

- `CELL`: cell parameters, ABC. Rule of thumb, A: x, B:, x-y plane.
- `COORD`: corrdinates of atoms in our cell. Can be include directly in `<input>.inp`, and more, one can use `@include *.xyz`

```
# rutile.xyz
# Atom.  x.               y								 z

Ti       2.29650000       2.29650000       1.47950000    
Ti       0.00000000       0.00000000       0.00000000    
O        0.89517570       3.69782430       1.47950000    
O        3.69782430       0.89517570       1.47950000    
O        1.40132430       1.40132430       0.00000000    
O        3.19167570       3.19167570       0.00000000   
```

- `TYPE`: For every elements you want to simulate, choose the basis set and pseudopotential. 

```
# basic structure of TYPE, <E> stands for some element
&KIND <E>
	BASIS_SET <some basis>
	POTENTIAL <some potential>
&END KIND
```
